## API DivX Player


</div>

### Description

A Lightweight mediaplayer wich main purpose is to play DivX (.avi) movies. It is made using API for everything except the sliders for seek and sound.

It has all the normal functions such as: Play, Pause, Stop, Open, Seek. You can increase/Decrease the movie with 25 % up to 300 and down to 50 % of original size, Or play it fullscreen. You can seek to any point in the movie. You can increase/Decrease the volume from 0-100 %. All functions has hotkeys except seek and open. The hotkeys play, pause, stop, increase/decrease volume even work in fullscreen mode. I managed to make this player due to that I got a piece here and there from you all here on PSC, and I also got great help from www.allapi.net. Thanks to all. Help me grow as a developer and come with feedback, bugreports and so on...
